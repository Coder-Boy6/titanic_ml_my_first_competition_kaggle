# titanic_ml_my_first_competition_kaggle
This repository contains my solution for the Titanic Machine Learning competition on Kaggle. It's my first competition, and I explore various machine learning techniques to predict passenger survival. The Jupyter notebook includes data analysis, feature engineering, and model training. Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute!
